Kimberley Shaw founder of intersectionality. 

How it started. 

>In employment scenario, it was segregated by both gender and race. So Black jobs were available majorly to black men and Women jobs were majorly available to white women. 

>In some sense the black men represented the whole black society irregardless of gender and white women represented all the woman irregardless of the race. 

>White femenists didn't understand the struggle of black women. 

>Multiple categories of potential discrimination may compund and interplay at this one individual. 

>Foucoult and the inclusion and exclusion of power. Mainly the inclusion of power is importatnt to the matter of intersectionality.
